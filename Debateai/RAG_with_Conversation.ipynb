The motion before us is this house would support affirmative action.\\n2. The problem that we're presented with is that across society there continues to be insufficient\\nrepresentation and advancement of women in major roles, particularly in major companies, political\\npositions and so forth.\\n3. Therefore, one mechanism of curing this to advance women's roles to see have women act as\\nleaders and to be included not only generally in the work force but in the highest echelons where\\nthey're where percentage wise they are far less than men, is to create some kind of mechanism to\\ncure for past and current discrimination.\\n4. Through this mechanism we would have affirmative action.\\n5. This effectively amounts to a a requirement that the major the major sections of different\\ndepartments in major companies, the heads of major the boards of major companies, of different\\npolitical groups in parliament and so forth, and of major groups in society generally have a particular\\nallotment set aside for qualified members of minorities, specifically women, and also people of color.\\n6. This of course would have to be on some level proportionally representational so that on some\\nlevel the company that that to which this is directed can effectively look like the like the look like the\\nwork force for whom it represents.\\n7. So for example, we might require that the board of a company have fifty percent women or a third\\nthird third people of color, so forth, these are not strict these are not strict numbers but sort of\\nguidelines for the kinds of requirements that you might have.\\n8.

So for example, women may frequently have been passed over for certain chances that\\npromotion, certain educational opportunities, certain different kinds of relative disadvantages they\\nmay experience even in an age of relative equality in which their careers have not advanced\\nbecause of particular subtle biases that people have about women women's capabilities.\\n13.

One example of this is that is that applications for two particular jobs, both entry level and\\nparticularly further up in the in the echelons of a company get passed over if they have female\\nnames or names the belong to a particular ethnic group or or stereotypically belong to people of\\ncolor and this is fundamentally not due to overt racism but through the subtle biases about the\\naccomplishments and capabilities of people from those groups.\\n15.

So in principle this is fundamentally problematic secondly, the the the burden created in terms of\\nof the cost that it takes to upkeep the institution of the monarchy and of royalty is fundamentally\\nproblematic in terms of the kinds of fiscal burdens it takes to continue and protect those institutions\\nand for those reasons we would get rid of the special status of people born into the royal family have\\nthem become private citizens change the holdings either to regular government functions or sell\\nthem off and fundamentally get rid of the institution of the monarchy and have parliamentary\\ndemocracies function without these without without without this institution without the trappings of\\nroyalty and the monarchy.\\n4. Give you two reasons why this is important and necessary.\\n5. Firstly because monarchy is fundamentally illegitimate. Particularly for democratic country and\\nsecondly because of the kinds of incentive in fiscal burdens that it presents and structural burdens\\nthat presents on on on the UK and other countries that have a monarchy.\"),\n",

So on a principled level the notion of democracy is the notion of the consent of the governed and\\nit's a notion of moral equality.\\n7. That is nobody has a special moral status or rank nobody deserves to exist on a higher level than\\nothers except through earned merit except through the kinds of our productivity that they deliver for\\nsociety through their voluntary choices and not through some prescribed moral status that means\\nthat the fact that you were born into a particular family doesn't make you more important than other\\npeople you're judged fundamentally in terms of your your relative power but the kinds of\\ncontributions that you make the kinds of jobs that you that you might that you might hold in terms of\\nproviding a public service and so on and so forth and in particular the people who rule over other\\npeople and in in in a country and particularly in democracy ought ought to be considered within this\\nmoral framework that is they're people who have the same special have the same status as\\neveryone else but who have chosen to work for the on the behalf of the public good and to help\\nenact laws, protect the public interest and so on and so forth.\\n8. Anyone who who who who who detracts from this mission and institution that is fundamentally at\\nodds which means that the monarchy is basically at odds with democracy because it relies on the\\nnotion of a scribed status based on an accident of birth.\\n9. This basically is a fundamental problem not only in principle but in terms of public perception that\\nis the notion that in order for people in power to be legitimate they don't need to earn the public trust,\\nthey don't need to do things that are substantial in order to succeed and we don't just mean earn the\\npublic trust in the sense that people like them.\\n10. Lots of people in many of these countries like the queen, think the queen is nice, think the queen\\nis a good institution, in the sense that it's morally incumbent on the public to see their public officials\\nas having needing to exist in terms of service and not just existing in terms of some kind of\\nfigure-head status or some kinds of arbitrary representative of the notion of the public will you have\\nto do something in order to be morally valuable as a member of government and not just claim the\\nright to rule than to rule over people even if that rule is in the case of the modern monarchy largely\"),\n",

Fundamentally what this does is morally it creates a message that the kinds of contributions that\\nyou might have to make in order to win power aren't necessarily very high.\\n12. With this does is it incentivizes public officials to associate them with the assumption of\\nprivileges without demonstrating the the the the legitimacy of assuming those privileges.\\n13. So what happens is you have people who are born into certain circles, or who are connected in\\ncertain ways to the queen and once they be they assume power they there is a decrease in the\\nnotion of the public perception of them having to truly represent the public and they're seen as part\\nof a higher echelon of society that's sort of generally removed, but kind of runs things in the in the in\\nin the way that we runs things more broadly and generally in terms of a classic of technocrats and\\nengineers who who run society for everyone.\\n14. This is fundamentally problematic because it decreases public pressure on seeing officials as as\\nneeding to contribute in order to be valuable.\\n15. And so not only on a on a principled level but not on a signaling kind of perceptual level this is\\nfundamentally problematic for increasing pressure on public officials to actually do their jobs\\nbecause if they once they join a a public system in which many members of the ruling class don't\\nhave to reflect the public will they soon become absorbed inside that system and the notion that the\\npublic has of of what government is supposed to be that is a reflection of of trying to create a certain\\npublic services and fulfil public needs is is diminished.\\n16. And this is fundamentally problematic still in this attitude secondly the fiscal burden.\\n17. So this this is is a corollary question to the general problem but fundamentally the institution of\\nthe monarchy is extremely expensive it has millions of up keeps in terms of all the buildings houses\\nsecurity servants all the different things that are involved to help help take care of and and defended\\nand protect and and and up-keep the institution of the monarchy and protect and help the royal\\nfamily this fiscal burden is extremely large the queen is one of the richest people in the world simply\\nbased on holdings that should legitimately be utilized and used by the people that she has simply\"),\n",

The motion before us is that this house would create a system of school vouchers. School\\nvouchers, fundamentally, are cash grants or subsidies to parents of children that they can then use\\nfor the purchase of education from any school which they desire. It involves getting rid of\\ngovernment provision or running of educational institutions and and pre-secondary and pre-college k\\neight through twelve schools but it maintains government funding of of education for the public.\\nWhat it means fundamentally is that the government stops trying to run and design the school\\nsystem but maintains people's access to education. What it does is allow people to spend money on\\nthe particular school that they want and service of their child with a minimal amount of money given\\nby the government and any extra money that they might require being topped up privately.\\n2. I'm going to give you two reasons why this is important.\\n3. Firstly, because it allows for choice in education.\\n4. And secondly, because it breaks up an educational monopoly.\\n5. So we have a fundamental value in society, and one that the governments in liberal democracies\\ntend to respect, which is the notion that choice is important.\\n6. Then the fundamental part of people's personal rights to autonomy is the ability to make such\\nchoices. One way to expand personal autonomy is to expand it in the educational sector. Under a\\nunder a state run system in which a national curriculum is designed by the state rather than chosen\\nby the school school itself, you have a you have can you have a singular model built on one notion\\nof how education ought to be taught, and all other alternatives are private options.\\n7.

Tobacco corporations are some of the like wealthiest corporations in the world, even if like a lot of\\nthe shares of people that like, even if the percentage of people that smoke in places like america are\\nlower, they're still high in a lot of places in europe, they're still high in a lot of places around the world\\neven.\"),\n",

Year round schooling will bring more good than harm for two big reasons. First because it's going\\nto help with the way in which people learn. It's going to actually help students academically and\\nsecondarily it's going to help students on a psychological level. It's going to reduce stress and it's\\ngoing to lead to a more positive schooling experience for students.\\n2. So let's start by talking about learning and about why this is going to help people learning.\\n3. Recognize that the way in which it the way in which people learn best is by constant\\nreinforcement of skills over time.\\n4. This is especially true for certain types of school classes like foreign language classes math\\nclasses things like that.\\n5. And the reason why this is important is because when you're in a lot of ways not just trying to like\\nmemorize facts but learning an entire system or like having to construct entire systems and things\\nlike that and possibly systems that you may not use all the time so while maybe you're more likely to\\nremember some of your english lessons if use that on a daily basis, or more frequently, you're not\\nas likely to use calculus on a daily basis so you're more likely to lose those skills if you don't practice\\nthem for an extended period of time.\\n6. And that extended period of time is exactly what happens when you have the incredibly long\\nvacations that happen.\\n7. So this is obviously very bad because when you have these more extended vacations students\\ndo forget a whole lot of things and when they forget these things it's necessary to spend more time\\nreviewing lessons and repeating lessons.\\n8.

Relearning is probably a better way to describe it because you can forget something entirely in\\nthe course of two months and over summer\\n10. so therefore it's essentially just a waste of time to have to relearn these things.\\n11. Things that could otherwise be taught.\\n12. But the next way in which this is going to help is this is going to help students from the\\npsychological perspective.\\n13. So most of the time a school routine can be quite rigorous.\\n14. You can wake up at like six o'clock in the well you have to be like wake up at six o'clock in the\\nmorning for a seven o'clock start to classes you may end classes at three PM but you probably have\\nto do like a sport or an extra curricular or a job and then by the time that's done you probably have\\nhomework that you have to do, or a test that you have to study for and repeating that process for\\nmonths on end every week is an incredibly draining and tiring process.\\n15. And therefore I think that people oftentimes do want more breaks like because it's not\\nnecessarily as important to have the one long break.\\n16. I think that people would generally find it a lot more relaxing, a lot more stressful if they could\\nevery once in awhile have those like four five day weekends, have a vacation instead of like having\\ninstead of having to do like the same week-long routines for three months in a row.\\n17. Having more breaks intermittently, which is going to be pretty good at reducing stress, making it\\nso that people are better able to cope with a rather strenuous schooling system that oftentimes\\nhappens.\\n18. So that's very important but additionally we also think that when there is more of a why we\\nadditionally think that when you have this long vacation there's more of a pressure to use the time\\nthat you do have the like the time window that you do have much more efficiently.\\n19.

So when you're doing this what is the big problem?\\n8. When you have some kind of patent or when you have intellectual property over something you\\ncreate a true monopoly over something.\\n9. If you were the an inventor of that thing and you like and whatever that means that you're have\\nlike a true monopoly over it because now you can literally take legal action against anyone who tried\\nto create an alternative or something similar to your product.\\n10. And that creates a big problem because it gives you a total monopoly which means that you can\\ncharge whatever you want.\\n11.

I can hurt someone like emotionally in ways that is not so different from being physically punched\\nin the face.\\n8. The way in which hate speech can truly rock your core and harm you is not something that should\\nbe understated and the reason why hate speech is outlawed.\\n9. So why do I think that holocaust denial is particularly a kind of hate speech that is definitely\\nshould be recognized and is definitely very pernicious, and this is true because holocaust denial is\\njust a slap in the face to the millions of jews that were executed by a horrible regime and moreover\\nthe descendants of those people who still live in europe to those days and the people who like carry\"),\n",

To deny the suffering that was a part of the holocaust, to deny the tragedy that was the\\nholocaust, trying to wipe it off the face of history, is just try to overlook the oppression that\\nessentially jews had to face and it's all the hardships that jews had to face and that's absolutely not\\nsomething that you should do because it's just like ignoring an absolute aspect of their lives and it's\\nreally demeaning to say that the like suffering of your people isn't something that actually happens,\\nsomething so blatantly factually inaccurate it's in a lot of ways an attack on jewish identity and it's\\nattack on jews because it's a way to try to make them feel lesser.\\n11. It's a way to try to make them feel vulnerable again and that's absolutely not something that\\nshould be protected.\\n12. It's absolutely something that should be criminal.\\n13. But, additionally I also think that there is a huge symbolic element here\\n14. and I think that when a government makes holocaust denial a criminal defense criminal offence,\\nthis is something that isn't going to go unnoticed and this is something that carries with it, since the\\nforce of the law has carried with this as a criminal offense, this is going to make a lot of people feel a\\nlot safer even if this doesn't actually lead to less holocaust denial.\\n15. It's going to make people feel more supported by the government and people feel more\\ncomfortable with the government.\\n16. So first and foremost, if you like want people to stay in a lot of these countries that's necessary\\nlike a lot of jews emigrate from places like france to israel because they don't feel safe in france\\nbecause of upticks in hate crimes and anti-semitic crimes, so on that level if you like want to keep\\njews in your country, if you want to keep a diversity religious diversity in your country, that's\\nimportant.\\n17.

Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for coming and hearing what I have to say about the\\nmotion before us today that we should allow doping in sports.\\n2. Now, I just want to make clear a few definitions before we go into the actual debate about what do\\nI mean when I say doping in sport.\\n3. Doping is the use of performance enhancing drugs.\\n4. When I am talking about sports I am of course referring to competitive sports, for example the\\nolympics or other kinds of competitions like tour de france etcetera, and we would allow the use of\\nperformance enhancing drugs, meaning medication that makes you perform better than you would\\nhave been able to naturally.\\n5. And why is it that we would allow doping in sport?\\nI'm going to make two main points.\\n6. First of all, that doping in sports is perfectly legitimate, and secondly, that it will create better and\\nsafer drugs that will counteract the harm benefits that we see under status quo from the use of\\ndrugs. Now, why do we believe that doping in sports is legitimate?\\n7. And we want to look at the place where competitive sports are right now.\\n8. We see that doping in a lot of ways is already part of the status quo and this comes in two ways.\\n9. First of all, because we already allow of the use of many other performance enhancing\\nsubstances or methods in order for athletes to provide a better entertainment value and also just to\\nperform better perform more extreme feats of sports, really defy the limitations of the human body.\\n10. So this includes first of all extremely rigorous training methods, right?\\n11. Because athletes train from extremely young ages, join competitions, their lives are regimented\"),\n",

Also all sorts of drinks and medications that you take during practices in order to numb pain or to\\nget more adrenaline, also if during competitions if you're injured you can take certain shots and stuff\\nlike that and are not considered performing performance enhancing drugs at all.\\n14. Under status quo all of these things are allowed.\\n15. Now, what's not allowed is some types of drugs that are slightly more extreme and the problem\\nwith status quo is that these things already happen, right?\\n16. But they happen very much under the carpet so almost every person who wins in olympics, in\\nextreme sports competitions uses some sort of performance performance enhancing drug and is\\nsimply not reported, right?\\n17. He's doing this illegally.\\n18. Some national teams even do this on a larger scale, for example the russian team that was\\nrecently caught taking drugs on a major scale and they were all disqualified from competing in the\\nolympics.\\n19. So we see that the notion of olympics and competitive sports as amateurs, right, is not\\nhappening because people train all their lives.\\n20. We see that this arbitrary line that we set of these drugs can't be taken but all of these other\\nmeasures can be taken, when in fact those measures are equally harmful to your health, we say\\nthat this as extremely arbitrary, we don't understand why it is that performance enhancing drugs are\\nnot allowed and we think that it's perfectly legitimate to use them.\\n21.

They can cause strokes, heart attacks, infertility, all different kinds all different kinds of steroids,\\nbut we think that there are two main problems in status quo that create these kinds of bad drugs.\\n24. First of all, the fact that these drugs are designed not only to increase your performance, but\\nalso to go undetected, right?\\nBecause these drugs are currently illegal.\\n25. So a lot of different components are put in these drugs in order to make them undetectable in all\\nsorts of tests and this this is what makes these drugs so dangerous and more dangerous at least\\nthat what they would have been if they just focused on performance enhancement.\\n26. So if these drugs were legal, at least the mild ones, we would be able to create drugs that don't\\nhave the added need to conceal themselves.\\n27. So you would have safer drugs.\\n28. And the second component we see that's problematic is that people are not really educated\\nabout these drugs so athletes are really, at the whims of their trainers, given all sorts of drugs that\\ntheir trainers heard of, that worked for other athletes, when really every different athlete's body\\nreacts differently, needs different drugs, different quantities, trainers are not medical professionals,\\nthey don't know necessarily what they're doing, and pharmaceutical companies can't create these\\ndrugs or supervise the drugs because they're not legal right now.\\n29. So we think that once these drugs are made legal, you have so much more information flooding\\ninto the market in terms of what these drugs can do how these drugs can help you how we should\\nuse them and trainers and athletes would be much better educated, and will be able to take better\\ndrugs.\\n30. Also now, a lot of the big pharmaceutical companies that have much more resources and much\\nmore knowledge would be able to use that knowledge and resources to create more drugs because\\nthis industry will undoubtedly become a very profitable industry for them.\\n31.

Thank you mr speaker regarding the motion before us today this that we should oppose male\\ninfant circumcision we want to clarify exactly what it is that we're talking about before making the\\nthree following point first of all the male circumcision, infant circumcision is a barbaric practice.\\n2. Secondly, that there are no proven benefits to it and thirdly, that children should be allowed to\\nmake these decisions over their body as these decisions are irreversible.\\n3. Before that I want to just clarify what it is that we're talking about.\\n4. Male infant circumcision is the ceremony of the large abrahamic groups, mostly islam and\\njudaism, severing the foreskin of the male genital organ at varying ages, usually at infancy, the child\\nof course has no say in this and this somehow initiates the child into the religion or the faith.\\n5. Now, what is our problem with this practice?\\n6. First of all, the fact that it's a barbaric practice, right?\\n7. It stems from a primitive notion of sacrificing a piece of flesh from a person in order to be initiated\\ninto a faith.\\n8. At the time where, you know, an extreme showing of loyalty.\\n9. This basically mutilates the genital organ of the body, not the way that you were born or as you\\nwere intended to be.\\n10. It is extremely painful and bloody, it's not done by a medical medical practitioner, rather by a\\nreligious authority, oftentimes there are things that go awry with this kind of practice, and this baby is\\nabsolutely traumatized, both bodily and mentally, for absolutely no reason other than showing a\\ncommitment to a religion of some sort.\\n11.

When the mass murderer in newton was caught it was discovered that he had planned his entire\\nmurder spree on the game kindergarten killers.\\n2. We think it is telling that cases like this happen and we think playing violent video games pushes\\nchildren towards more violence in real life.\\n3. Based on that metric, we'd like to ban the sale of violent video games to underage children. We're\\ngonna talk about three things: one, on the active role children take in violent video games, two, on\\nthe reward system set up in violent video games and three, on normalization via repetition. So first,\\non the active role taken: this is to separate video games from things like violent movies or scary\\nstories.\\n4. We think the specific problem of video games is that the violence is an action that you specifically\\ntake yourself.\\n5. That means that, in order to punch a hooker in GTA five, I don't sit back and watch, but rather I\\nactively choose to press the button over and over again.\\n6. This means that the individual barrier between taking the action itself and just seeing it, is broken,\\nbecause you do, in fact, have to make the active decision to do it, time and time again.\\n7. Secondly, on the reward system: the way video games work is that they compel you to commit\\nviolent acts based on a reward system.\\n8. That means that if you commit a violent act, you get a prize, you get points, you get levels in the\\ngame.\\n9. You get advancements in the storytelling, in the story line of the game.\\n10. This means that you are gifted every time you commit this act.\"),\n",

This conditions you over time that violence brings your rewards.\\n12. This is particularly problematic because there are times in real life where violence is likely to gain\\nyou rewards.\\n13.

If you were to punch someone and ask for their milk money, you're more likely to get it, based on\\nviolence.\\n15. The idea that a reward system is set up for violent actions is in and of itself very problematic\\nbecause it pushes children more towards violence.\\n16. Thirdly, there's a normalization via repetition.\\n17. So, when you see something time and time again, it becomes normalized in your eyes.\\n18. That means that, for example, when people see pornography over and over again, the sexual\\nnorms within them, within pornography are normalized for these people and they are expected.\\n19. They view this as what is normal to a sexual relationship.\\n20. The same thing is true of violence.\\n21. At the point at which you see violence over and over again and in fact take active part in this\\nviolence over and over again, this violence is normalized in a way that makes you believe that it is\\nan actual part of everyday life.\\n22. Why is this a problem specifically for kids?\\n23. The way these games work is that they take life experiences that are specifically for children,\\ndisconnected.\\n24. So, violent video games will often be military games, they will often be driving games like GTA,\\nsometimes they will even be games that are generally disconnected from the lived experience,\\nmeaning space pilot games, etcetera.\\n25.

As a result of that, children growing up in the thirties and forties became some of the most\\nsuccessful, most and most privileged people in the united states because that's how markets work:\\nsupply and demand.\\n3. If supply is greater than demand, the people get hurt and fail.\\n4. Briefly, we simply support that china continue doing what it's been doing up until now and, in\\nbroader terms, we support regulation on childbirth and places where childbirth is excessive.\\n5. Two arguments on this side of the house: one, on legitimacy in doing so and two, on a need for a\\nsmaller society. So first, let's talk about legitimacy in doing so.\\n6. The main argument heard against the one child policy is that people have a right to childbirth.\\n7. What's interesting to note is that the population in china has been growing by about oh point five\\npercent every year.\\n8. Note that given birth rates and death rates should coincide plus or minus, if each person were\\nhaving one child, that meant that birth rates would stay the same.\\n9. Given that children are had in couples, this means that if people were actually sticking to the one\\nchild policy, birth rates would be dropping, meaning the population size wouldn't be growing but\\nrather dwindling.\\n10.

The most important thing to understand in this debate is that a king or a queen, a monarch, are\\nnot a title but rather a symbol. They symbolize a unified head of state, they symbolize a\\nrepresentative of the people, but not of some of the people like a prime minister, but all of the\\npeople. What we say here is that this debate is not about whether such a symbol is a good symbol\\nto have, but whether such a symbol should take the familial form of monarchy or the more inclusive\\nform of presidency. We want to create a new symbolism because of stagnation of the monarchal\\nsymbolism created in places like england and the netherlands. We think that a system such as israel\\nwhere you have an elected body which is the prime minister and the parliament, and aside from that\\nyou have a president who is elected as well every seven years from anyone, but he is elected by all\\nthe people and represents to an extent all the people.

Secondly, there are certain settings in which speech must be limited. So, most people say\\nfreedom of speech would include lies as well. You can basically say anything you want.\\n15. For example, you can say that donald trump is going to be an excellent president, regardless of\\nhow stupid that may be.\\n16. There are certain situations in which individuals cannot lie.\\n17.

So, while they do do that often and technically can do that, we say it is morally wrong and given\\nthe option, we should probably prevent that in the first place.\\n19. The reason for that is that that speech is actively harmful towards other people.\\n20. Secondly, already today, witnesses are prevented from lying. Why?\\nBecause exercising their freedom of speech without limitation would mean that the right of a\\nseparate individual would be taken away. Now let's take that notion and expand it into conceptual\\nlimitations on freedom of speech. We say there are certain such speech that is unacceptable.

The reason is because racial slurs around society are something which large groups of people\\ncannot feel safe in.\\n31. So it undermines the feeling of safety and bodily autonomy that groups of individuals have.\\n32. Why are these things so important that they should override the freedom of speech? We say\\nthat freedoms are derived from the ability to exercise them. At the point at which an individual loses\\nhis life, that individual loses the ability to exercise all freedoms.

Let's start off by talking about how the voucher system works in comparison with the system of\\nstate-funded education that we have today. So, in the most basic sense, the voucher system means\\nthe government stops spending money for you and lets you decide where to spend your tax money.\\nYou get a voucher saying here is ex money and you can use this for any form of education for your\\nchildren.\\n2. What does that mean on the bottom line for education?\\n3. One, it means there is a more equal distribution of the funding for education.\\n4. Why?\\nWhen giving out vouchers, a state is obliged to give identical sums of money to each and every\\nindividual.\\n5. In comparison, when funding schools, what you end up getting is political battles in which the\\npolitically strong and big cities and richer areas get substantially more funding for their schools.\\n6. Now, you'll wanna say look, funding schools allows us to invest more in schools in the periphery\\nwhere people need it more. That is, to an extent, true, though hypothetically can also be done with a\\nvoucher system, but the important thing to note is that that's not what actually happens. What\\nactually happens is that the rich people and their political capital get more and the poor people get\\nless.\\n7. Secondly, the voucher system adds geographic dispersion verses locality.\\n8. What does this mean?\\n9. It means that the point at which the schooling system is we build schools based on how many\\npeople live in the area and need to go to school, it also means that the state forces you to choose,\"),\n",

You are limited if you want to go to a state school, to schools in your direct area.\\n11. That means you're limited to going to school with the same people who are in your\\nsocioeconomic standing and limited social mobility that comes from this.\\n12. With a voucher system, you are essentially free to travel as far as you are willing to in order to\\nget a better or more diversified education.\\n13. So that's the second thing that happens.\\n14. The third thing is that you're extending the free market.\\n15. In today's society, most people are not so rich that they can afford to opt into paying for a private\\nschool as opposed to receiving school entirely for free.\\n16. This means that even when there are people who would hypothetically be able to afford school,\\nmost people are locked into a monopoly of the state on schooling because they manage to offer a\\nfree alternative, something no one else, no business can offer.\\n17. At the point at which the voucher system is put in place, it means that people have a starting\\ncapital in order to pay for school.\\n18. This means two things: one, any person can pay a certain amount which opens up the market\\nalready and two, those who before couldn't pay a lot but were able to add some, are now able to\\ninvest some more over the voucher price in the education of their children. This means you get more\\nschools built and you allow the free market to work in a way that says that the good schools will\\nremain and the bad schools are likely to shut down due to lack of participation.\\n19. Now let's talk about three things that happen based on the voucher system.\\n20. One, we say you get better education.\\n21. So, at the point at which the free market runs its course and you get to opt into the types of\\nschools that you want without geographic limitations and with equal distribution between social\\nstandings, we say the first thing that happens is you get better teachers, better schools, better\\neducation for the children.\"),\n",

The second thing you get is free thinking education. So, at the point at which schools are\\nreleased from the claws of the government, you enable more education to be tailored to the wants\\nand needs of students and parents.

This means\\nmore things like philosophical schools, more things like training schools, and at the very best, it\\nmeans that the state no longer has a monopoly over controlling the narrative taught to all high\\nschool students, a power best held by many individuals and not by one body.\\n23. Thirdly, we say this creates an equal opportunity in education. So, we already explained why this\\ngives substantially more access to better schools for poorer people, but it does more than that. It\\nenables the mixing of the societies at the primary school level. This means that you have friends\\nwho are rich and poor. This means that you have friends who are of color or white. This means that\\nyou have an array of knowledge over different aspects and parts of life that allow you as a poor\\nperson to advance through social circles, up until now, a gift given only to the rich and only to the\\nprivileged.

When you cannot ensure that what you're getting is clean, is the good stuff, is the real stuff,\\nwhen you cannot ensure that you're getting exact right medical quantities, the risks from taking\\nthese drugs goes significantly higher.\\n38.

Games create this repetition right you have stress levels, you have high anxiety levels when\\nyou're turning a corner in these games or when you're approaching a car or a certain situation.\\n23. Then you have your trigger action, you have your violence, you have your beating somebody up,\\nyou have your pulling the trigger, you have you're stealing the car, raping women.\\n24. This this violent reaction\\n25. and then you get a reward and you're flooded with a good feeling.\\n26. We think that this kind of repetition is going to lead to instinctive reactions in real life.\\n27.

In other words, we think that it's very likely that government and other agencies discriminate\\nagainst first nations people and other disprivileged people without realizing that they do so, creating\\nmore of a need for protection among these groups.\\n11. Therefore, we think we ought allocate representation to these groups because they have more\\nneed for protection from the types of institutions where we would see this sort of preferential status\\nfor these disprivileged people.\\n12.

We think that it is very possible that when an entire organization is made up of privileged people\\nthat it seems entirely natural that this organization be made up of privileged people.\\n16. There's no one present, after all, to challenge the narrative that these people deserve to be the\\nonly ones involved.\\n17. We think that when you begin to see, for instance, women involved in universities, that people\\nrealize that this isn't the case and ought not be the case and that unfairness is exposed for what it is.\\n18. This happens better if we have affirmative action because it is easier to include minority groups\\nor women in these institutions.\\n19. Therefore, we think that future biases will be better realized.\\n20. Why is this such an important thing?\\n21. If you care about the rights of future people who are disprivileged right now, or children who are\\ngoing to be born in the future, we think that they probably have a right to grow up in a world where\\nthey have access to equal opportunity, and that in order to create such a world, we may need to\\ntake steps now to equalize past inequalities and to make right past wrongs.\\n22. So with those points in mind, I'd like to talk a little bit about pragmatic reasons for affirmative\\naction.\\n23. Broadly speaking, we think that minority representation is a good thing in groups like congress or\\nuniversities.\\n24. In order to reach this type of minority representation, we first need a tipping point of people who\\nwere involved in these groups this is true for a couple of reasons.\\n25. One, we think that once these minority groups are represented in congress, it's likely that there\\nwill be future representation.\"),\n",

So in other words, the only way to ever access minority representation is to have affirmative\\naction in the status quo.\\n29. This is the least restrictive means that we can impose since essentially what we're telling\\nuniversities and government is that they need to include people, not which individuals to include.\\n30.

But on top of that, that the need for affirmative action is reduced in the future if we have institute\\nthis policy.\\n35. In other words, if people are allowed to access things like higher education, like positions in\\ngovernment, they will be better able to advocate for themselves and to achieve equality in society\\nand for these reasons, not need affirmative action in the future.\\n36.

So first of all, we tell you that boxing creates harmful norms in communities.\\n15. We tell you that boxing creates the idea that fighting is something to be glorified, that we should\\nbe paying people to engage in fights and other harmful behavior.\\n16. We think that at that point, and I'll talk more about that in a minute, we think at that point that the\\ngovernment needs to get involved, to step in to prevent this behavior which is harmful to other\\npeople.\\n17. Any behavior which encourages someone to be antisocial, which encourages violent behavior,\\nwe think ultimately the state has a clear interest in regulating and preventing that for the good of\\neveryone who might be a victim of that violence or who might be harmed by that behavior.\\n18. And we're going to say that boxing is fundamentally different than other sports.\\n19. It might be true that rugby or american football lead to some people being injured, but the\\npurpose of those sports is not to injure your opponent whereas in boxing, necessarily you're trying to\\nharm your opponent.\\n20. Even in wrestling, it's possible to have a very successful wrestling match where no one is hurt in\\nany way because you'll play holds, and that someone taps out.\\n21. In boxing, the only way to win is to hit your opponent, and knockouts are usually the way that\\nyou seek to win.\\n22. So at that point, we tell you this is extremely dangerous, you know, obviously losing\\nconsciousness is bad for you, but also fundamentally different from any other type of sport. So we\\nthink the state can intervene here without damaging sport as a whole. Our second point is what we\\nthink the world would be like in a world where boxing were banned. We think it would be better on\\nseveral levels. First of all, we think that boxing feeds into a toxic culture of violence.\"),\n",

You see people like michael vick become public enemies for mistreating animals, etcetera.\\n27. But floyd mayweather has remained very popular, and I think in large part that's due to the\\nculture that boxing creates.\\n28. Necessarily, when you set up a sport where in order to be successful, you need to be violent\\nand aggressive, it seems that you create a culture where violence and aggressiveness are\\nrewarded.\\n29. So we think that people like floyd mayweather, who we don't really want to have in society, are\\nbeing enabled and encouraged even produced by the culture that surrounds boxing.\\n30. So we think that stepping in to end boxing would ultimately reduce that violent culture and lead\\nto less celebration of this behavior, and not normalize young people to the idea that that type of\\nbehavior is okay.\\n31. Because we think that by tolerating boxing now, you ultimately tell young people that this type of\\nbehavior is acceptable and therefore, ensure that it'll be perpetuated in the future.\\n32. But I'd also like to point out that we wouldn't tolerate the idea of boxing anywhere else in society.\\n33. So, in general, fighting is illegal between two adults.\\n34. If you get into a fight in public, the police will break it up in most countries.\\n35. If you get into a fight in private, it's expected that other people will intervene.\\n36. We don't see why it's consistent to allow people to agree to fight in a tiny boxing ring as opposed\\nto anywhere else in society.\\n37.

Now it's probably true that there's going to be a transition period as an area becomes more\\nmulticultural, when you're going to have some backlash, and we think that's unavoidable.\\n9. But we think that, in the long term, what you're going to see is that people who grow up in this\\narea now will be more accepting of those who are different from themselves.\\n10. We tell you that people who grow up in an area where everyone is like them, looks like them,\\ntalks like them, thinks like them, simply experience fewer challenges to their world view, which\\nmakes it more difficult for them to understand potential shortcomings to their world view and their\\ntraditional opinions.\"),\n",

So recognize that when you arrive in a new country, you probably speak a little bit of the\\nlanguage, but you don't know as much about it as someone who was born there.\\n14. We think it's really helpful for people moving to a new country to be able to access a community\\nthat has some things in common with their home country and some things in common with the new\\ncountry.\\n15. A good example of this would be chinatowns in any major western city.\\n16. So, when a lot of people move to a new country from china, they move into an area where\\nthere's a lot of chinese people, and this community can help them to learn the language because\\nthere's a lot of people who speak whatever chinese dialect these people speak.\\n17. They can help them to get jobs so that they can start supporting themselves right away in their\\nnew country.\\n18.

We support the one-child policy of the people's republic of china.\\n2. So by this we mean that we should restore the policy to stricter enforcement and that it should\\nhave stronger deterrents.\\n3. So the one-child policy basically says that people who live in most of china's provinces, especially\\nhan chinese people ethnically, are only allowed to have one child per family or else, they face fines\\nthat are graded by income.\\n4. So on our side, we want to restore this policy because it's recently been weakened by the\\ncommunist party, and we also think that there should be higher fines and more deterrence for\\nfamilies that violate the policy.\\n5. So our first argument, we have three, is about why this is better for children.\\n6. So recognize that people in china have relatively small incomes compared to people in the US or\\nbritain or other western countries, and your share of the pie is even smaller if it's subdivided more.\\n7. So basically, incomes in china are growing, but if you keep dividing up people's resources\\nbetween two, three, four children, then each child is actually receiving a relatively small investment\\nand this is bad for a few reasons.\\n8. With the one-child policy, we can access more education, parents can easily afford to send one\\nchild to university or to high school when they couldn't afford to send two or three children.\\n9. We tell you, therefore, that you're more likely to get educated people.\\n10. We also tell you that more jobs are likely to be be available.\\n11. Just because your family has two or three children, doesn't mean that the economy is able to\\ncreate two or three jobs.\"),\n",

So we tell you that, ultimately, it's more likely that these children will have access to good,\\nhigh-paying jobs that'll give them good quality of life on our side.\\n13. We also tell you that they're likely to be healthier because more money can be invested in their\\nhealth and their well-being.\\n14. They're more likely to see a doctor and things like that.\\n15. And so we tell you, overall, that these children will have a higher quality of life with the one-child\\npolicy than they would otherwise and that that, in and of itself, is enough reason for the chinese to\\nstrengthen this policy.\\n16. Our next argument is that this will be better for the chinese economy.\\n17. So china doesn't have a problem with manpower. They already have the largest population.\\n18. What they need are educated workers.\\n19. Basically, more middle-class workers is better than more rural low-income workers.\\n20. So right now, the one-child policy creates a situation where even a low-income rural family can\\nnow afford to send their one child to high school so that they can get a better job and become\\nmiddle class.\\n21. Ultimately, we tell you that this is better for the economy because those people can then go on\\nto work in more productive jobs, and not just work in a factory or work on a farm, and that this is the\\nfuture of chinese growth.\\n22. China is already an industrial and agricultural superpower.\\n23. What they need to do now is grow in the service sector and grow in high tech and other sectors\\nthat right now are dominated by the US and western countries.\\n24. We tell you that they can do that better with the one-child policy.\\n25. And we also tell you that china's historical overpopulation strains their economy.\\n26. Basically if you have too many people, then when food and other goods become more\\nexpensive, everyone is strained because things are stretched more thinly, there's more demand for\\ngoods, so ultimately they're going to be more expensive in times of need.\"),\n",

So the biggest problem that a country can have, broadly speaking, or one of them at least, is lots\\nof young men without jobs.\\n31. If you look in chinese history, one reason why there was so much turmoil in the nineteen sixties\\nwas that there were lots of young people who didn't have jobs, who didn't have a lot of opportunity\\nbecause of overpopulation, who were willing to go and become red guards and do all the terrible\\nthings that happen during the cultural revolution, because they had no other opportunity.\\n32. To look a little closer to the present, the arab spring and all the violence that's happened in syria\\nand elsewhere in the middle east has largely been driven by the presence of lots of young men\\nwithout economic opportunity.\\n33. Basically, a militant is an unemployed young man with a gun in his hands.\\n34. On our side, when there are there's less of this surplus of young people, we tell you that there's\\nless likely to be this kind of violence, because young people who have jobs and education are more\\nlikely to be happy, more likely to be content, less likely to have time to be radical and ultimately, are\\nless of a threat to society.\\n35. But we also tell you that a strong economy leads to more trade, which leads to less conflict.\\n36. So think about china and japan. Historically, they're enemies. There were lots of wars between\\nthem in the early twentieth century. One reason why it's very difficult to imagine a large-scale war\\nbetween china and japan now is that was they trade so much.\\n37.

At that point, we ought abolish monarchy to ensure that all people are in fact treated and seen\\nas equals.\\n14. The second argument is about religious tolerance.\\n15. Often monarchs are seen to rule by divine right. This excludes people from other religious\\ntraditions than the one that enshrines the monarch.\\n16. Oftentimes this isn't a religious tradition which is a majority in the country, or it excludes religious\\ntraditions that have become common in a country since the time when the monarchy was first\\nformed.\\n17. This normalizes preferential treatment for a state or other religion.\\n18. We tell you that we think that this is unfortunate since all people are seen to have equal right to\\npractice their religion, and many people would feel as though they didn't have that right at the point\\nwhere they had a monarch who was seen as as legitimized through a certain religious tradition and\\ncelebrated by the state.\\n19.

We tell you that one form this could take would be a tax rebate.\\n6. In the united states, parents can receive a tax credit if they have children below a certain age.\\n7. We think that this might work in a similar way in terms of people receiving a break on their taxes,\\nrather than receiving a direct cash transfer.\\n8. So, with that in mind, I have three arguments about a better education, about the rights of parents\\nand about what is best for the children.\\n9. So, in terms of better education we tell you that on our side of the house, schools can no longer\\nbe complacent.\\n10. Right now, schools know that they will receive students whether or not they offer a high quality\\nof service.\\n11. But by implementing this policy, if schools do a poor job educating students, then they will\\nreceive fewer students, access fewer vouchers and have less funding.\\n12. We tell you that schools will not want this because they want to have more funding for things like'),\n",

So, when schools have to compete, they will be more likely to actually implement, like, new\\nforms of educational policy.\\n14. So we think that we better reward innovation.\\n15. In other words, if there are new teaching techniques or continuing education that's available for\\neducators, schools will now be rewarded for encouraging their teachers to pursue those things and\\nfor like hiring people who'll be able to implement these new types of education.\\n16. But on top of that, we think that state schools are often overcrowded, particularly in low income\\nareas.\\n17. We think that one of the largest barriers facing students in these schools is a lack of attention\\nfrom teachers.\\n18. So, if you have fewer students in public schools because now more people can afford private\\nschools, we think that students will get more one-on-one time and have better access to education\\nbecause they'll actually get the attention they need to learn.\\n19. We also tell you that you'll get better education because you'll get more community investment in\\nschools.\\n20. By this we mean that parents will be more likely to invest their time in a school if they're giving\\nup this voucher which represents a tax credit, rather than if the money is automatically taken out and\\nthey never see it directly.\\n21. We tell you that when people feel like they're paying for something they feel a sense of\\nownership and this will be more obvious on our side of the house when you have to turn over a\\nvoucher rather than just having the school exist and be funded by taxes in the abstract.\\n22. I'm sure that the other team is going to get up here and say that schools would be underfunded\\non our side of the house, but we think that the lack of overcrowding will offset the lower funding that\\nschools will receive and ultimately, students will be better off for this reason.\\n23. Our second point is about the rights of parents.\"),\n",

In other words, if you want to send your kids to a parochial school, you could only afford to do\\nthat if you have a lot of money.\\n26. We think that it's unfair if you have to pay for public school even if your children aren't educated\\nthere.\\n27. Recognize that right now in countries like the US and britain, whether or not your children go to\\nstate-provided schools, you're still paying taxes that fund those schools.\\n28. We think that it is wrong to force parents to pay for a service that they're not receiving and also\\nthat it's wrong that only wealthy parents can afford different types of schools.\\n29. We think that by giving this voucher, parents would be able to afford to send their children to\\nparochial schools, or even if not every parent could, many more parents would be able to do so, so\\nsociety would be comparatively better-off with respect to the rights of parents. We think it's also\\nimportant that parents have a tremendous right to choose what is best for their children. We allow\\nparents to do things like name their children, decide where their children grow up, decide if their\\nchildren play sports or if they do boy or girl scouts. Ultimately, we see that parents are allowed to\\nmake lots of decisions.\\n30. Why should they not then be able to make a decision about where their children go to school?\\n31. We think that this is principally inconsistent and that opposition, in order to win the debate, will\\nneed to explain why choosing where your children go to school is meaningfully distinct from all of the\\nother important choices parents make.\\n32. We think that parents deserve to be able to do what is best for their children and that ultimately,\\nparents know what is best for their children more than anyone else since they spend so much more\\ntime with them and since they're more invested in them than any other actor, which leads nicely into\\nour third argument about what is ultimately best for the children attending these schools: we think\\nthat the most important issue in this debate is what is best for the children who are being educated.\"),\n",

So, even in the worst case they receive more individual attention, as I mentioned earlier, so,\\nthey're still better-off than they are right now in the status quo.\\n35. But in the best case, these children are able to go to a better school.\\n36. For instance, if you had a special-needs child who needed to go to a school that the state\\nwouldn't fund but that, at the same time, would be really beneficial for this child to learn, they would\\nbe much better-off on our side of the house.\\n37. We see that in the status quo most states provide for things like schools for the deaf but don't\\nprovide schools for, like, autistic children and other groups that might need special attention.\\n38. They require them to go to school with the general public when these students may not be well\\nserved there.\\n39.

So, because we get better education, because we better uphold the rights of parents principally,\\nand because we get better outcomes for students, particularly special-needs students, I think it's\\nclear that we should embrace school vouchers.\\n41.

We should allow doping in sports. So by this we mean steroids, human growth hormone, and\\nother similar drugs should be allowed in pro and amateur sports. So we're okay with this and things\\nlike the world cup, the premier league, the olympics, the NBA, any kind of major sport, whether it's\\npro or amateur, any kind of doping technique that is deemed safe by doctors for people. So we\\nassume that we're going to allow doping that's overseen by the kind of trainers who are already\\nadministering these drugs in the status quo illicitly. So our first argument is that banning doesn't\\nwork.\\n2. So there are new drugs developed every year.\\n3. Recognize that there are lots of different hormones and other chemicals that athletes can use to\\ngain an advantage.\\n4. It's not as though we can test just for testosterone or just for one other drug and then solve the\\ndoping problem.\\n5. One reason why it's been such a pervasive problem in sports is that new doping techniques are\\ndiscovered all the time, and the regulatory agencies just cannot keep up with the athletes\\nthemselves, because there's such an incentive for people to go ahead and take this risk and dope.\\n6. We also tell you that doctors and drug companies are complicit.\\n7. Drug companies are putting out new drugs that they know can be used by athletes to be taken\\nadvantage of in doping, and doctors who work for these athletes have a huge incentive to keep their\\njobs, to prescribe these drugs, and to help them get them and take them even if they're not actually\\npermitted.\\n8.

More on that in just a minute, but the point is that her doctor actually gave her these drugs, so\\nthere's no way to separate the medical need from just the doping itself.\\n12. So what we think you should do is regulate and promote safety and information, not fear, and\\nthat this would be better for athletes and ultimately, better for the sports if you didn't have people\\nputting themselves at risk by actually taking these drugs.\\n13. So next, our second argument is that doping is not inherently bad.\\n14. Basically, the only reason doping is bad is because right now it's against the rules for major\\nsports, so athletes have to cheat in order to take advantage of doping.\\n15. If we made it okay within the rules, then athletes wouldn't be doing anything wrong and doping\\nwould no longer be a bad thing.\\n16. There's nothing inherently wrong with doping.\\n17. There's nothing that's evil about taking human growth hormone or anything else. You're not\\nhurting other people, you're not undermining the sport, more on this in just a second. So we think\\nthat actually you should allow it, and then these people wouldn't be doing anything wrong.\\n18. So, why don't we think this actually hurts sports?\\n19. So first of all, athletes still work really hard.\\n20. Even athletes who take advantage of these drugs are still getting up at five in the morning to\\ntrain.\\n21. They're still running.\\n22. They're still going to the gym.\\n23.

So we think that natural gifts don't go away, and hard work doesn't go away.\\n25. One of the most celebrated things about sports is that the kind of hard work people put in is so\\ninspiring to others, and we think that that doesn't change even if doping is made legal.\\n26. So we should allow it, and people will still love sports.\\n27. We tell you another reason why this is complained about is that some people think that viewers\\nwould be turned off from sports because of doping.\\n28. But that doesn't seem to necessarily be true, right?\\n29. Barry bonds was a really famous american baseball player who got caught doping, and people\\nloved watching barry bonds play.\\n30. Before they knew he was doping, people thought that he was just an amazing player and they\\nreally admired him.\\n31. And even after he was found out, a lot of people thought that major league baseball should have\\nlet him keep playing because they wanted to keep seeing what new amazing things barry bonds\\nwas going to do.\\n32. People want to watch good baseball, people want to watch good sports.\\n33. They don't really care about whether or not someone has been doping or not.\\n34. The only reason right now some people might think that players like barry bonds should get\\nkicked out of the league is because they're cheating under the rules.\\n35. So if you change the rules and it was no longer cheating, we think that the main objection that\\npeople have would actually be taken away, and everyone be free to just enjoy baseball or other\\nsports.\\n36. But on top of this, we tell you that the quality of competition would actually be higher.\\n37. Basically, if you let people achieve peak performance by using these drugs, then whatever sport\\nyou're talking about is going to be better.\\n38.

So we think, therefore, if you care about the quality of sport, you should actually want players to\\nbe taking these performance-enhancing drugs, you should actually be in favor of doping.\\n40. The last thing I'm gonna talk about here is why I think that anti-doping campaigns actually ruin\\nsports.\\n41. And the example I want to use is lance armstrong.\\n42. Look, if you're my age or maybe a little older, lance armstrong was probably a hero to you\\ngrowing up.\\n43. Everything that he did, winning the tour de france, beating cancer, was so impressive.\\n44. He was a role model for young people around the world and older people, I'm sure too, people\\nwho are going through cancer, everybody could look up to lance armstrong.\\n45. So unfortunately, it came out that lance armstrong had been doping, and a lot of people lost\\ninterest in cycling, a lot of people thought that their hero had been undermined and probably\\nbecame more cynical about the value of sports and promoting role models and things like that.\\n46. So we think that this anti-doping campaign actually did more harm than lance armstrong taking\\nsome hormones ever did.\\n47. Look, at the end of the day, lance armstrong won a race because he took some human growth\\nhormone or some other doping techniques.\\n48. We tell you that the harm of telling the entire world that he was a cheater actually was much\\ngreater than the harm of him doing this.\\n49. So we think that at the end of the day, if there hadn't been this anti-doping campaign, if it had\\njust been okay for him to take these hormones, to dope, that it would have been better for everyone\\ninvolved.\\n50. Everyone could have continued to a like take advantage of the enjoyment that they got from his\\nachievements and the inspiration he created around the world.\\n51. So for these reasons, we think that it's clear that we should allow doping in sports. Thank you.\\nRebuttals:\"),\n",

Three points today: one is to understand why we have a responsibility to do something.\\n6. Second of all is to understand why this helps us fight the type of discrimination which creates the\\nlack of opportunity for people and thirdly, why we think this is the only effective way to do this. So on\\nto the first point, why do we have a responsibility?\\n7. We say that our societal infrastructure, our government, our society are the ones who caused the\\ndamage to these people.\\n8.

All of these reasons create less situations for people and increases the amount of discrimination\\nthat we have towards them.\\n14. So, we'd say that this means two things that are critical for us in this discussion: one is that\\nmeans we have a responsibility and we have to protect them, but\\n15. second and moreover it means that it is okay to harm the people who will not be getting the jobs\\nthat other that the minorities and or any other people who towards them we will be doing affirmative\\naction, it is legitimate for them to lose their jobs for them because they have so far enjoyed and have\\nbenefited at the expense of the people who have been disenfranchised by society, therefore it is\\nlegitimate to harm them and any case regarding that is irrelevant.\\n16. So, that is why we have a responsibility and it is morally okay to harm other people to do so.\\n17.

Two main reasons: one is sorry, two main types of discrimination: one is we'd say that there is\\njust like direct discrimination as in people who are racist, people who are sexist, people who are\\nxenophobic and so on and so forth, and the second type is people who don't do it consciously,\\npeople who do it subconsciously, and this would be considered the second wave of discrimination\\nwhere people don't realize but if they're a man, they prefer other men to other women and so on and\\nso forth.\\n19. Why do we think we help prevent both types of these discrimination?\\n20. So, regarding the first type, we'd say that they just don't have a choice.\\n21.

I realize that there is a lot of similarities between between me and between them\\n26. and I think I realize that they are just as capable of doing the job as anyone else is capable of\\ndoing the job.\\n27. So, this regards the racists who are inherently racist by just putting facts in their face, showing\\nthem that they are completely wrong, but regarding the the subliminal racism, as one would put it, it\\nalso deals with them because it it takes it from the subliminal and puts it in their actual conscious\\nand allows them to see that what they thought is wrong and therefore change the way that they think\\nregarding even the subliminal messages.\\n28.

Why is it relevant to this to our case today?\\n33. Because we we'd say that what we're doing with this policy is disincentivizing you.\\n34.

It also then creates another inequality, which is then there are better teachers want to go to these\\nbetter schools where there is more funding and more infrastructure because they prefer to teach\\nthere and they'll probably get a a higher salary.\\n8.

One, because even in those in those neighborhoods now the schools are better because they\\nwill be receiving more funding than they are today because each student is now worth the same\\namount of money, and the fact that your parents come from money or the fact that you go to live in a\\nspecific neighborhood or your parents have more political power doesn't mean that you're worth\\nmore than every other student so their schools will automatically be better.\\n38.

We say that today because the the the schools in not such good neighborhoods are not as\\ngood, then the then the chances of someone from a good neighborhood going to that school is\\nextremely low.\\n41. But tomorrow, when when we have this competition, we have different schools trying to embetter\\nthemselves, there is a higher chance of people being willing to go cross the neighborhoods to the\\nother to to the other schools and try and create more integration within society because those\\nschools could be even better than the ones in their neighborhood.\\n42.

We see that all of these things lead to better social mobility because you had the better\\neducation allowing you to go to college and getting into better places, but also because we have\\ncreated more integration within society, allowing people to to help promote each other and get to\\nknow each other and therefore, give more opportunities to each other, all creating more social\\nmobility.\\n44.

In this speech we're gonna talk about why we should ban violent video games.\\n2. And to clarify the problem that we're trying to solve here is not the fact that violent video games\\nare distasteful or offensive but rather that in developed western world countries, children spend on\\naverage more than six hours per week playing video games and video games are uniquely effective\\nat teaching and in particular violent video games are uniquely effective at teaching violent antisocial\\nand anti-empathetic behaviors.\\n3. Now before we get any further to clarify exactly what we're talking about, we're talking about\\nbanning video games in which realistic violence is central to the gameplay or that feature explicit\\nphotorealistic cutscenes that display graphic violence.\\n4. And to explain our position on this issue we're going to talk about two different issues.\\n5. First, the fact that video games are uniquely effective teaching tools. And second, the fact that by\\nits very nature, the regulation system under the status quo is ineffective at preventing children from\\naccessing these video games, and therefore that a ban is the only reasonable way to expect to\\nachieve any sort of concrete results. So to get into the first point, gonna talk about the the the the\\nnature of video games and why they're so effective at teaching behavior.\\n6. Now, in this generation, children's begin playing video games at an extremely young age.\\n7. It's part of the core curriculum in education in many preschools and kindergartens around the the\\nthe modern developed world.\\n8. And this is an age obviously when these children are malleable and they're still learning\\nappropriate human behaviors.\\n9. And naturally the mechanism by which children learn is by observing others and through\"),\n",

This is the natural sort of mechanism by which human beings learn how to act in a social\\nsociety.\\n11. The problem is that violent video games they masquerade as real-life lessons.\\n12. Nowadays video games involve they contain lifelike graphics, and we\\'re not talking about\\nsomething like pac man here, we\\'re talking about photorealistic graphics all the way down to the\\ntiniest facial features and facial tics and expressions and to extremely graphic displays of blood et\\ncetera.\\n13. Now because of their realism, it\\'s very easy for these video games to be confused with real life.\\n14. And another feature of the violent video games is because violence is sort of the central\\ncomponent of gameplay, in particular in shooting games, etcetera, there the lesson that is being\\ntaught sort of subconsciously is that violence is the solution to every problem.\\n15. Throughout the entire course of the game every problem that the player faces is solved with a\\ngun.\\n16. And in contrast to violent movies or other media, in order to progress in these violent games, the\\nplayer himself actually has to press the buttons, actually has to execute the actions in order to in\\norder to see the results and in order to progress through the game. For example one of the most\\ncontroversial scenes in video games in in recent memory is a \" call of duty \" game from a few years\\nago in which one of the levels involved involved walking through an airport and mowing down\\ncivilians, simulating a terrorist attack from the perspective of a terrorist.\\n17. And players actually had to walk through the airport and pull the trigger, shooting women and\\nchildren, mowing people down.\\n18. And then, in order to encourage this kind of behavior, all of these video games contain within\\nthemselves a system of rewards and achievements and progress, which is to say the positive the\\npositive encouragement that is central to how human beings learn.\\n19. So this, what we have here is the exact mechanism by which human beings, by our very nature,'),\n",

And instead, because it\\'s a video game, everything is sort of replaced with simply digital\\nencouragement, rewards, access to new levels, to new guns.\\n21. And so, we could see that the the behaviors that are taught by these by these video games are\\nsort of only shown to be positive things which to adult eyes may not be very confusing but to\\nchildren\\'s eyes can be easily confused for real life lessons.\\n22. Now in addition to the violence, these games also tend to exaggerate and glorify a sort of\\nmachismo in violence.\\n23. This includes the treatment of women as sex objects.\\n24. One of the more successful games in the last ten years was the \" god of war \" series which\\ninvolved literally having sex with prostitutes as a mini-game.\\n25. And so to reiterate, the problem here is not that these are distasteful and people may find them\\ndisgusting, but that they are extremely effective teaching tools.\\n26. And that and this brings us to our second point, the current system of regulation is by its nature\\nineffective.\\n27. Nowadays, in modern gaming consoles and computer gaming, anyone can go online and buy\\nfrom amazon or download.\\n28. All you need is a credit card which and the credit card number is usually stored on the system for\\nwhich the purchases are being made.\\n29. So basically children have access to these video games and the ability to purchase them without\\nany sort of parental supervision.\\n30. And furthermore, furthermore, most parents are considerably less educated about video games\\nand video game ratings than their children are.\\n31. So it makes it very easy for children to, you know, to go behind parents back and sort of sort of'),\n",

And we propose simply an adherence to the one child policy that was already in place up until\\nrecently they switch to a two two child policy with an added bit of mechanism in which we give a tax\\nincentive or sort of a tax break for families that have a female child in order to help to offset the\\neconomic costs that are incurred by families that have a female child instead of a male child.\\n3. Now, this is not, of course, a normative judgment of one gender or preference for one child over\\nthe other, but simply a recognition of the cultural realities in china and the fact that in chinese culture\\nthe when when children come of marrying age the tradition is for the female child the female, the\\nwife to join the husband's family and and so many chinese people are reluctant to have just one\\nfemale child because it means that they will not have a child to take care of them later in their life\\nbecause she joins the husband's family.\\n4.

Although the freedom of speech is one of the most basic tenets of a free and open society and\\nthe most critical components of a functioning democracy, we recognize that there are certain\\nsituations in which freedom of speech certain kinds of speech are not constructive and do not\\ncontribute to the public discourse in any way and are instead, the opposite.\\n2. They are destructive, they cause they actively cause harm to other individuals and therefore must\\nbe limited, which is why we believe that the freedom of speech is not absolute.\\n3. We're gonna talk about two main points here. First of all to clarify what we mean by freedom of\\nspeech is not absolute. We believe that there are certain instances where censorship is legitimate\\nand the freedom of speech should be limited, and we're gonna talk about two main points here.\\n4. First of all, the fact that we're going to explain the the idea behind why words have the power to\\ncause harm, and second of all, we're going to give some examples of when speech should be\\nlimited that clearly convey our point here.\\n5. First of all, a little bit of explanation about what what we're talking about, what sorts of free speech\\nand and why they have the power to cause harm.\\n6. Because, of course, we understand that the people the proponents of absolute free speech say\\nthat speech is nothing more than the expression of opinions, it's nothing more than words, words\\ncan't harm, they're just vocal noises.\\n7. There's nothing dangerous about that and people should have the ability to do to to say and to\\nsay whatever they want to because at any any time it begins to be limited, then we are suppressing\\npeople, and taking away people's rights, and making a return in the direction of sort of a fascistic\\ncontrolling government.\"),\n",

But when we talk about limiting free speech, we're not talking about the expression of opinions or\\ncriticisms.\\n9. We're not talking about the discussion of new ideas.\\n10. What we're talking about is the fact that words are tools to communicate a message and they\\nvary in terms of their content, in terms of their volume, the number of people they reach, in terms of\\nthe frequent frequency with which they are uttered.\\n11. And all of these things, when pushed to an extreme, can potentially be dangerous because\\nhuman beings are social creatures and therefore, words are not just words in a vacuum.\\n12. They're not just noises with no consequence.\\n13. Words often inspire action, and they often inspire feelings in other human beings.\\n14. Words can lead people to do terrible things or words can lead people to feel terrible things.\\n15. And we're not talking here about just hurt feelings or or a bruised ego, but we're talking about\\nactual fear for one's personal safety and well-being.\\n16.

And now to give some concrete substance about what we're talking about here, we're gonna\\ngive some examples of times when freedom of speech should absolutely be limited, when it causes\\nfar more harm than good.\\n18. First of all is the most classic example of limitation of free speech, which is the idea of someone\\nyelling fire in a crowded theater.\\n19.

When we consider the fact that the use of performance enhancing drugs in sports is an offense\\nthat is incredibly subjective in nature, and we also consider the sheer amount of time effort and\\nmoney that is wasted every year on testing athletes and funding organizations that drug test\\ncompetitors, becomes very clear that we should allow a doping in sports.\\n2. And when we talk about doping we're talking about the use of basically any performance\\nenhancing drugs such as testosterone, human growth hormone, etcetera.\\n3. Now we're not fighting to make illegal drugs legal, but we are saying that we should remove any\\nand all penalties that are imposed by sporting organizations on athletes that have been that have\\ntested positive for the use of of such drugs.\\n4. And the reason we believe that we should engage in in this motion that we should pass this\\nmotion is because first of all, it's good for sports, second of all, because athletes should be free to\\ndo what they want to with their bodies, and third of all, because as we've seen in recent years,\\nthere's simply no way to stop it and because most of the harms of doping arise from our failure to\\naccept it as a fact of reality we're better served by simply accepting the fact that it doping occurs\\nwhen will always occur.\\n5. Now, why do we say that doping is good for sports?\\n6. So, counter intuitively here, we say that sports are spectator events.\\n7. Fundamentally, sports are about the the this the spectacle, the fact that there are viewers most\\nsports people generally don't consider to be worth playing unless it's televised, unless it's seen by\\npeople.\\n8. People rarely play on unless they're people rarely engage in their sport unless it's on a stage.\"),\n",

Especially when we're talking about professional leagues such as the NFL, the NBA, when we're\\ntalking about things like the olympics, and part of the reason we say that they're spectator offenses\\nbecause first of all, so much effort goes into televising it\\n10. but\\n11. and but that is a result of the fact that most of these sports are can only exist because they are\\nfunded by spectators, they're funded by the people who wish to see the sports, which is what allows\\nthem to flourish in the first place.\\n12. And all of these sort of consideration and elevation that athletes enjoy to superstar status comes\\nas a result of the fact that they're not just engaging in their sport, they're not just practicing their\\ncraft, they're doing so on a stage in front of people.\\n13. That's what sports is all about now, we say that doping is good for sports as a spectator event\\nbecause people, spectators, the fans, are only really interested in seeing the highest level of\\ncompetition.\\n14. We know that this is the case because people watch the NFL and the NBA far more than they\\nwatch college football or college basketball, and they watch college football and college basketball\\nfar far more than they watch high school football or high school basketball, and the same goes for\\nbasically every other sport because people are interested in seeing the spectacle of the human body\\npushed to the limits and the ultimate in what humanity is capable of.\\n15. And so because PED's improve athletes, they improve the quality of the competition, and\\ntherefore they provide a better show for spectators, which draws more viewers and draws more\\nattention from around the world, and therefore thereby pumping more money into the sport and and\\nand and bring more fame and recognition and appreciation of athletes, which thereby draws even\\nmore people to the sport, both as spectators and as future players.\\n16.

Now, getting into our second point here, the other reason we believe the PED's should be\\nallowed in sports it's because athletes have bodily autonomy and should be free to do what they\\nwant to with their bodies.\\n18. They already, first of all, make incredible sacrifices for success.\\n19. Anybody who competes on an international level, on the global stage and basically any sport, be\\nit gymnastics, or football, or soccer, or at the olympics for any event, makes incredible sacrifices in\\nterms of time, usually in terms of money too, for all the people that don't end up making it and in\\nterms of their their personal relationships they're making incredible sacrifices in order to achieve a\\nlevel of proficiency in talent and skill to compete on such a level.\\n20. We said that they should be they are allowed to do this, they they choose to do this of their own\\nvolition and they should be allowed to and they should be allowed just like that with PED's to use\\nperformance enhancing drugs, even if they may be unhealthy or even if they may be risky, because\\nit's a sacrifice that they're clearly willing to make for the sake of being competitive at an international\\nlevel.\\n21. And furthermore, we say that PED's are not unique in conferring an unfair advantage, quote\\nunquote, because you know we've seen over the course of time that every time a new tactic is\\nemployed by athletes people call it unfair at first.\\n22. For example, the first olympic high jumper that jumped backwards over the bar as opposed to\\nforwards was called a cheater because he was doing things in a non traditional manner.\\n23. And the first football team for example to prepare for a game by watching footage of the\\nopposing team and learning their tactics and strategies were called cheaters, but now both of these\\nthings are common practice and used by everybody that competes in these sports because it's not\\nan unfair advantage, it's simply the evolution of the sport.\\n24.

We should ban boxing.\\n2. At the beginning of this this debate, we think there's something important to recognize about\\nboxing, which is that oftentimes, when we consider whether or not we should ban something, there\\nare often reforms that can be associated with whatever we are considering banning, that could\\nalleviate much of the harm that arises from the thing that is being banned.\\n3. But when it comes to boxing, we simply don't think that it is possible to reform it, to the point\\nwhere it isn't simply a blood sport, where at, its very basis, boxing is this thing, in which we pay to\\nsee two people beat themselves up, to see them brutalize each other, and we get this this pleasure,\\nthis visceral pleasure from seeing this type of bloody violence.\\n4. We think that at its heart, that is what boxing is, and we think that in any other context, we\\nwouldn't view boxing as a sport, but as a crime.\\n5. We think that just because two people may be able to consent into going into a boxing match, it\\ndoesn't mean that the signals, the social implications of boxing, don't have reverberations that are\\nunjust, and it doesn't mean that those people can immediately consent into these things. So, this is\\nwhat we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about harms to the self, to boxers themselves,\\nand we're going to talk about the bad social impacts from boxing.\\n6. So firstly, on the boxers themselves.\\n7. Boxing as a sport is one of the most dangerous sports that exist.\\n8. Concussions and brain damage are incredibly common, arising from boxing.\\n9. People oftentimes suffer from long term brain damage, because of the damages they take during\\nboxing.\"),\n",

Because people can't internalize, they can't fully fathom the harms that they're taking upon\\nthemselves, we don't think it's actually possible for them to consent in a meaningful way, because\\nthey can't properly weigh the gains that they could potentially get from boxing, against those long\\nterm harms, and we think in these instances, the government or the state is justifying in banning\\npeople from taking these actions.\\n14.

Multiculturalism brings more good than harm.\\n2. When we're talking about multiculturalism what we mean is is to have a diverse set of cultures\\ninteracting with each other and existing, and co-existing in one proximate location.\\n3. This doesn't necessarily mean that these cultures are blending together in any particular way\\n4. but it's just that these cultures are able to coincide and to exist with one another. What this is, this\\ncould be compared to societies in which there's a monoculture or one prevailing social idea of how\\nto live, or the types of food, all the things that wrapped up in what cultural reasons. So, we're going\\nto talk about two things: we're talk about culture as an expression of the self and culture as an\\nexpression of society. So firstly, we think that culture is incredibly important to one's expression of\\nthe self.\\n5. We would say that society constructs the self.\\n6. That individuals are not blank slates from tabula rasa monoliths that walk through society and\\nmake themselves, but rather they are created by the society that they are born in.\\n7. They learn from the culture that surrounds them and their tastes are attracted to that which their\\ncultures bred them to be attracted to.\\n8. So, individuals have particular desires for things that their culture dictates them to have.\\n9. Whether this is a desire to live a particular type of lifestyle or to live an active or not active lifestyle\\nwhether to pursue particular types of sports or foods or things like that.\\n10. We think that all of these, and a variety of other preferences, are embodied within the culture\\nthat one has.\\n11. So multiculturalism allows for better expression of the self and more self fulfillment.\"),\n",

This is for two reasons: firstly, the diversity of cultures when it exists allows for people who do\\nnot feel safe or connected to their particular culture to find other expressions and other outlets for\\nthe things that they care about.\\n13. It allows them to explore and to learn more about what the world has to offer.\\n14. About the many variety of ways in which the individuals may live, and from there to find one that\\nis more fulfilling.\\n15. It means that individuals that feel trapped within their communities have an outlet in which they\\ncan express that express that anxiety and from there we think multiculturalism allows for a diverse\\ngroup of people to live simultaneously without having to impede each other's desires.\\n16. We also think that more cultures build more diverse people.\\n17. So even if people don't feel excluded from their own culture, we think that when individuals get\\nthe type of cultural education that comes with living amongst a variety of cultures, they're able to\\nbetter understand their own culture they're better to able understand their own habits their own\\npractices, and they're more able to critically examine those things, which means that when they're\\nproblematic they're more likely to turn away from them which we think is good broadly, but it also\\nmeans that they can take other cultures into their own life and become more diverse and well\\nrounded individuals which again leads for more avenues of self expression.\\n18. Secondly, multiculturalism in society.\\n19. We think, firstly, that when you have a multicultural a multicultural society it makes it easier for\\nother microcultures and smaller subsets of cultures to develop.\\n20. This, again, we think is preferable because in a society in which more cultural exploration is\\nencouraged, it ensures that more people are able to express themselves in the way they want and\\nnot be demonized for how they express themselves, which we think is ultimately an expression of\\nfreedom and good within society.\\n21.

When you are able to live side by side with other cultures, when you're able to live in a society in\\nwhich you're not directly tied to the culture that you've been born into and you live in a multicultural\\nsociety, we think that you breed a better social background and a better blending of cultures that\\nhelps people and helps maintain society.\\n25.

We think that, even though these violent video games are unlikely to lead to these types lead to\\nthese people like actually creating and committing crimes in the future.\\n6. What we think these things do is desensitize youth to the violence that exists around them.\\n7. And especially at a point, in which these people are very young, if they already become\\ndesensitized to these things, while they're young, we think they're unlikely to try and respond to\\nthem passionately and politically in the future.\\n8. And this is crucial, because we think that, if you don't have a politically active group, if you don't\\nhave a group of young people that see violence, and see the problems in the world, as something\\nthat need to be solved, as something that isn't normal and okay, that, what would likely happen is\"),\n",

Even if this is a marginal chance of happening, we think that these crimes can often be so\\nheinous, murder, and other types of assault, that people learn from violent video games that normal\\nlike shootings and things like this, we think that, you shouldn't take these risks, especially because\\nthere's no positive benefit gained from allowing these people to have access to these video games,\\nand as I'll explain in a moment, they're not full agents, and therefore restricting their rights is not a\\nmoral harm.\\n11.

We think under this legal system, given that there are certain risks that come from desensitizing\\nthese individuals, we think that, it is simply in line, with the logic of our legal system, to restrict them\\nfrom being able to do this.\\n14. Furthermore, it's clear that individuals become more autonomous, and more able to make\\nchoices with age.\\n15.

It can lead to gum disease.\\n7. It can deteriorate your health and a number of cosmetic and non cosmetic ways that can be\\nincredibly detrimental, and to subsidize tobacco only through public funds is to use public funds in a\\nway to hurt the public.\\n8. It's like if you're going to use public funds to further police communities in a militaristic way.\\n9. To have military rule over society.\\n10. Now obviously this isn't this is not the same degree of that, but we think that it's similar in kind\\nand that it's using public funds to harm the public.\\n11. So we think that is the first reason why this is simply unacceptable.\\n12. The second reason is that we think that it kind of that undermines the whole point of a subsidy to\\nsubsidize the tobacco industry.\"),\n",

When you don't have intellectual property rights it means that ownership of ideas, things like\\nscientific discoveries, things like technological innovations, these types of things aren't protected by\\nIP laws which means the information about them is much more freely available.\\n13.

What do we think this means? We think it means that you get longer and broader innovation in\\nthe long term.\\n15. In the short term, we think that people are more likely to collaborate.\\n16. People are less likely to be secretive about ideas which means we think that we can falsify like\\nbad ideas quickly.\\n17. We think that technology is more efficient right off the start because we think that people are\\nless likely or less incentivized to quickly bring ideas to market so that they can patent use types of\\nthings and we think that long term you get a society that has greater innovation because you're\\nmore able to synthesize ideas that that otherwise would've been blocked by intellectual property\\nprotection.\\n18.

What we think the reason for this is that if rights are based on arbitrary standards, for example if I\\narbitrarily decide that animals should be excluded because they're not human, allowing for arbitrary\\ndistinctions in who can and cannot serve rights, opens the door for allowing any sort of arbitrary\\ndistinction.\\n9.

We need to abolish the monarchy.\\n2. Before we begin we need to clarify something because there are many different models and types\\nof monarchies in the world, starting from models where the monarch is a de facto ruler with absolute\\nauthority on all of the political decisions being made, like in saudi arabia or qatar, to models where\\nthe monarch is more of a diplomatic symbolic figure with hardly any authority when it comes to\\npolicy, like in great britain.\\n3. For the purposes of this debate, all of these models, we will argue, need to give way in favor of a\\ndemocratic republic.\\n4. Of course, the more authorities that the monarch holds, the bigger our problem becomes. We'll\\nhave two points in the debate. First, we're going to explain the rationale of why we had monarchs to\\nbegin with, and why this rationale is no longer valid today, and the second point, in the second point\\nwe will discuss the harms of a monarchy on under all models. So, first point.\\n5. It used to be that monarchs all had absolute authorities, and the legitimacy for their rule was that\\nthey managed to persuade the people that they had a divine the right to rule.\\n6. The royal families were nearly god like, and this is why the title passes on and is hereditary, and\\npasses on from father to child.\\n7. Now, the rationale behind it, as put forth by political philosopher thomas hobbes, was that we\\nneeded someone that one ruler above everyone else in order for there to be order in the street.\\n8. Otherwise, we would have anarchy.\\n9. If no one was there to give out rules and enforce them and punish someone if he harmed me,\\nthen everyone would do as he pleases, and this is bad for everyone.\"),\n",

Therefore, it's best to just sacrifice some of our liberties to a single ruler that will create order in\\nthe streets.\\n11. But as time went by, and the more the citizens became aware of their own rights and started\\ndemanding things from their kings, the authorities of their of the monarchs dwindled down and\\nbrought us to the development of a democratic republics.\\n12. And now there are plenty of examples of states that have no king but there is still not an anarchy\\nin the streets, and all that is needed in order for that to happen is a functioning government, a\\nparliament that makes laws, and the courts to to enforce them.\\n13. This thus, the old logic and rationale behind having a monarch is no longer valid today.\\n14. The new rationale given sometimes, especially in great britain, is that we are talking about an\\ninstitution that is ingrained in the tradition of the people and in their culture and history, and all of\\nthat is very true.\\n15. But nostalgia and romanticism can only get you so far.\\n16. This is exactly what museums are for.\\n17. We're not saying that we should just forget about our history, but just like viking culture is a very\\nimportant part of the nordic countries' history, this does not mean that they should go out and ravage\\nthe seas today.\\n18. We should put that behind if we don't have a stronger logic behind that.\\n19. Now, the monarchy comes at a very high price, and we need to consider whether it is worth it,\\njust in favor of nostalgia.\\n20. This brings me to my second point, where I will discuss the harms of the monarchy.\\n21. Along the years, there have been good kings and there have been bad kings, but the biggest\\nproblem is that the people have no control over what their king does, except maybe for violent\\nrevolutions when they try to remove the king, and this is of course something that we would like to\\nprevent in the future.\\n22.

Now, this all comes from the taxpayer's pay roll and this is the taxpayer that did not elect this\\nmonarch to begin with.\\n34. This is not legitimate.\\n35.

They weren't always so taken for granted.\\n8. They only exist several centuries at best, and they're always meant to serve a certain purpose.\\n9. Now there are two different sets of rationales given to specifically the freedom of speech.\\n10. Let's deal with the first.\\n11. So the first rationale is an instrumental one.\\n12. It says that allowing people free expression is meant first and foremost to allow a living\\ndiscourse of ideas that will eventually make sure that no idea is being taken taken for granted and\\nthat no ideas are being forcefully silenced by the government or anyone else and thus, society can\\nmove forward and progress.\\n13. But certainly not every type of expression is moving society forward.\\n14. What happens when free speech is threatening to take society backwards?\\n15.

In cases of incendiary comments that are playing on people's fears and reigniting old social\\nproblems that society is still licking its wounds from, and sometimes might even bring indirectly to\\nactual violence, like we see for instance in donald donald trump's rallies, there is no way of seeing\\nthis as something that is strengthening society.\\n17. And so, the very purpose that brought us to constituting the freedom of speech to begin with\\nshould bring us now to prevent these like speech these expressions from ever taking place.\\n18. Now the second rationale is very different.\\n19. It doesn't see speech as an instrumental thing, but but rather says that allowing a person to\\nspeak his mind is something that is inherently good.\\n20. It doesn't matter what results from it.\\n21. Thought expresses our freedom and independence, and there is no point to thinking something\\nif you cannot share that thought with other people.\\n22.

This leads to a unification of the contents passed on in schools and different schools now\\ncompete with one another and try to attract students mainly based on a superficial differences and\\nthings such as appearance, and not based on the content that they're offering.\\n20. Now, we believe that this is a shame because different children have different needs when it\\ncomes to education and there is absolutely no way that having just one universal learning program\\nis going to fit everyone's needs.\\n21.

In this debate, we're dealing with a question that could change the face of sports as we know it.\\n2. To properly answer it, we have to, first of all, ask what is the ultimate goal of sports?\\n3. From this we can derive what are its most important attributes and see whether the use of doping\\ndefeats the purpose of sport or rather serves it.\\n4. To clarify, we will stand for the legalization of performance enhancing drugs that aren't\\npsychoactive or physically addictive, namely, steroids and the likes of it.\\n5. In the first argument, we'll lay the core of our case and explain how doping is part of the natural\\nevolution of sport.\\n6. In the second argument, we're going to counter some classic opp.\\n7. Arguments and discuss the other effects of legalizing doping.\\n8. Let's go to the first argument: we believe that sports is a lot like art.\\n9. The main reason we care so much about sports is that it gives us inspiration.\\n10. Professional athletes serve as an example and a reminder for what beautiful things can be\\nachieved when combining talent with hard work and discipline.\\n11. Therefore, the most important quality sports needs to entail in order to fulfill their purpose is first\\nand foremost to be thrilling and moving and fun to watch.\\n12. True enough, there are also other elements that are fundamental to sports.\\n13. For example, the competition element that symbolizes, like, a friendly rivalry.\\n14. But the competition itself also eventually serves the higher purpose of inspiration 'cause it helps\\npush the athletes themselves to their limits and also to create more interest and emotional\\nattachment for the audience.\"),\n",

It's much like musical competitions, like the eurovision or reality TV shows like america's got\\ntalent.\\n16. The competition is merely a means to make the music more appealing to larger audiences.\\n17.

And so, the most valuable trait a sport needs to possess in order to achieve its purpose is to be\\na beautiful and intriguing spectacle.\\n19. Why is this so important?\\nBecause it's not easy to maintain a thrilled audience for very long.\\n20. People lose interest in new fashions very quickly and in order to survive the crowds modern age\\nshort attention span, sports, as all things, have to keep changing and evolving.\\n21. For that to happen, it is imperative that new records keep getting set all the time.\\n22. No one will be interested in the olympic games is they would believe that no record can be beat,\\nthat the best is already behind them.\\n23. Notice how people keep drawing comparisons like is lebron bigger than jordan, and all of these\\nthings.\\n24. So, how is it possible that new records keep getting set all the time?\\n25. Well, it's mostly due to technology advancements.\\n26. We kept making better running shoes so usain bolt is able to outrun his predecessors. Better\\nswimwear and swim gear so now we get michael phelps doing the amazing things he does. But\\nthere eventually will come a limit to this and we are reaching this limit. Doping is exactly the thing\\nthat can take us to the next level. Think about how many artists, like musicians, filmmakers, plastic\\nartists feared the rise of technology and computers and that it will take over the art world. It is\\neventually the ones that were smart enough to embrace it and use it as part of their art that survive\\nthe test of time. The same thing needs to happen to happen with sports.

So, some might be worried about the negative health effects of using these substances.\\n28. To them we say that being a professional athlete is, surprisingly, probably one of the least\\nhealthy things one can choose to do with incredibly high risk of getting injured.\\n29. So, if they're really worried about the athlete's health, they might they might as well ban sports\\naltogether.\\n30. Some argue that sports is all about being natural and that it's the artificialness of these drugs\\nthat defeats the purpose of sports.\\n31. To them we say that for decades now, if not more, there's been nothing natural about the way\\nprofessional athletes prepare for their competitions.\\n32. They go on elaborate diets, they use all kinds of incredibly strong food supplements.\\n33. In fact, we urge opposition to explain what's the big difference between protein supplements and\\nsteroids. We don't think that one exists.

Better-funded sports clubs get better athletes, better trainers, better equipment, etcetera.\\n36. Now, the second answer to this particular line of argumentation is that we believe legalization\\nwill, if anything, have the opposite effect.\\n37. Today, many athletes still use doping illegally, case in point, the story of the russian delegation\\nto the twenty-sixteen olympic games, only that the richer and better connected clubs or countries, if\\nwe're talking about international competitions, are more easily able to get away with it while others\\naren't.\\n38.
